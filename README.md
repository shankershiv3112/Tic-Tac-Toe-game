# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
Built a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players alternate between "X" and "O" on a 3x3 grid, with real-time win detection and a reset function. The game is fully responsive, ensuring smooth gameplay on both desktop and mobile. Showcases my skills in JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and responsive design.
